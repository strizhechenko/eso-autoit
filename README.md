Few Elder Scrolls Online automations for routine operations

I don't want to violate the EULA with automating my game experience entirely like creating bots to gain experience/killing mobs/farming materials, but some of in-game routines are really boring and take too much time just because the interface sucks. I also think these problems are possible to solve by creating an addons but I don't know lua and ESO's API.

## Problems solved

- receiving money/expired item from guild-store sale takes 3 keypresses
- refining a lot of materials requires you to make `(X materials / 10)` keypresses
- improving an item to epic grade takes about ten seconds and ~9 keypresses/mouseclicks!

## Installation

You need [autoit](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/), I recommend the full installation. Use SciTE editor and build binaries from scripts in repo and put them whereever you want.

## Usage

Don't afraid to look at code, it's small and simple.

1. Run the binary you need.
2. F10 or F11 starts the routine
3. In some cases F10 is a pause.
4. F9 is exit.
